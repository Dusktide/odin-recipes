        With tons of fresh herb flavor, this Greek spinach rice is a simple dish with complex flavors. 
        Serve as a side dish with grilled chicken, lamb, or stew, or by itself as a vegetarian main course. 
        The fresh squeeze of lemon juice and feta crumble are critical to the taste — don't leave them out!
