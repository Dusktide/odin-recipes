               <li>1 ½ cups medium-grain white rice </li>

               <li>½ cup packed finely chopped fresh dill</li>
               <li>½ cup packed finely chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
               <li>1 pound frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry</li>
               <li>2 ¾ cups cold water, or more as needed</li>

           </ul>
       </p>
       <p><h2>Steps:</h2>
           <ol>
               <li><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
                Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. <br>
                Add rice and stir until every grain is coated in oil and you hear it start to sizzle. <br>
                Stir in 2 teaspoons salt, pepper, cayenne, and green onions and cook for about 1 minute.<br>
            </li><br>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong><br>
                Add dill, mint, spinach, and 2 3/4 cups water. Mix until thoroughly combined and bring to a simmer.
            </li><br>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong><br>
                Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until rice is tender, about 25 minutes. <br>If rice is not quite ready at 25 minutes, add a splash of water, cover, and continue to cook until it is ready.
            </li><br>
            <li><strong>Step 4:</strong><br>
                Uncover and stir well. Cover again and let sit for 5 minutes. Taste and adjust salt if necessary.
            </li><br>
            <li><strong>Step 5:</strong><br>
                Divide rice mixture evenly into six bowls. Squeeze ½ lemon over each serving, then top with feta cheese, pickled onions, chili flakes, and a drizzle of olive oil.
