        When you're short on time or patience, waiting an hour or more for an oven-baked potato might seem like a tall order. <br>
        That's why this recipe is so darn good â€“ you can have a perfectly microwaved baked potato in just a little more than 10 minutes! <br>
        It sounds too good to be true but, we promise, this recipe is just as good as reviewers say it is.
